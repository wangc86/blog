**Course Name:** CSU0032 Engineering Mathematics 工程數學 <span style="color:red">(Spring 2022)</span>  
**Instructor:** Chao Wang 王超  

The purpose of this early announcement is to attract enough number of students to take this course, in the hope to meet our school's requirement on the enrollment numbers, to make this subject available to undergraduate students in computer science and information engineering. So, please help spread the word. I'd appreciate it.

Topics that I plan to cover:
* First-Order Differential Equations
* Second-Order Differential Equations
* The Laplace Transform
* Series Solutions
* The Fourier Integral and Fourier Transforms
* Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
* Applications in Computer Engineering and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)

Students who would like to take this course should learn Calculus first.
