## Course Syllabus
Engineering Mathematics is the core subject in many engineering branches. For computer science and information engineering (CSIE), Engineering Mathematics serves as a mathematical foundation for machine learning/deep learning, computer graphics, multimedia processing, and cyber-physical systems (CPS), to name a few, and it could be a gateway for you to explore other engineering disciplines (such as electrical engineering).

Since this is the first time in the recent ten years that we offer Engineering Mathematics in our department, we will cover at least the following key topics and, depending on how the class will go, we may cover some additional topics:

1. First-Order Differential Equations
2. Higher-Order Differential Equations
3. The Laplace Transform
4. ~~Series Solutions of Linear Equations~~ Numerical Solutions of Ordinary Differential Equations
5. Matrices and Vector Calculus (Complementary to topics covered in Calculus II and Linear Algebra)
6. Fourier Series and Fourier Transform

Students who would like to take this course must learn Calculus first.

### Grading Policy  
* 60% Homework assignments  
* 20% Midterm exam <a name="schedule"></a>
* 20% Final exam

## Accessibility
<a name="integrity"></a>
Students in need are encouraged to bring their considerations to the instructor.

## Academic Integrity
All homework assignments and exams must be completed individually and independently, except as specifically allowed by the instructor. 

<a name="hw"></a>
Academic integrity is a key component of your education, which is for your benefit. Anyone found to be cheating or helping someone else cheat will receive zero score for that homework/exam. Please reflect on the university's [motto](http://archives.lib.ntnu.edu.tw/c2/c2_1.jsp): Sincerity 誠, Integrity 正, Diligence 勤, Simplicity 樸.

## Homework Assignment 
All homework assignments will be announced on [Moodle](https://moodle.ntnu.edu.tw/).
