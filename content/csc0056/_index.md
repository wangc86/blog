## Course Syllabus

In the 2020 edition of this course, the theme is _messaging in cloud/edge computing systems_.

Data communication is essential for networked computing systems. The objectives of this course are for students to:  

* gain insight into analyzing data communication systems;
* have hands-on experience in systems performance evaluation; and
* engage in recent advances in data communication systems.

In particular, we will

* learn the basics of the queueing model and analysis;
* learn both Google's gRPC framework and the widely-used MQTT communication protocol; and
* learn to study selected research papers.

**Prerequisites:**  
Basic working experience in C, C++, and Linux.

**Grading:**  
* Homework 45%  
* First Exam 20% <a name="schedule"></a>  
* Final Exam 25%  
* Participation 5%  
* Attendance 5%
