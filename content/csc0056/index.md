## Course Syllabus
**Description:**  
Data communication is an essential part of modern computer networks and Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems. The objectives of this course are for each student to:  

* learn classic data communication algorithms and protocols;
* gain insight into analyzing data communication systems; and
* engage in recent advances in data communication systems.

The first half of this course (i.e., before the first exam) will focus on how to analyze a data communication network. The second half will cover some classic algorithms and protocols in data communications, followed by recent advances in this field.

<a name="schedule"></a>
**Prerequisites:**  
None. Students are, however, recommended to be familiar with materials taught in _CSU0019 Computer Networks_ or an equivalent course.

<a name="resource"></a> The readings assignment each week is designed for you to gain some background of the topic _before_ class. Read them and note where you find interesting and/or challenging. Bring your findings to class for further discussion. I will also cover some additional materials in class.
