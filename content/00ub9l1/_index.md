Fluency in the academic use of English is key to your success in the study of science and engineering. Historically, a significant portion of the body of knowledge is written and communicated in English, and it would be an unfortunate loss to us if the language itself prevents us from the access to it.

In this course, we will introduce the basics of academic English in the setting of science and engineering. The course includes four modules:

1. Effective and critical reading of scientific literature
2. Elements of nonfiction, technical writing style
3. Structures of research papers and technical reports
4. Verbal and visual presentation using academic English

Base on my background, I will cover the materials in the context of computer science and engineering. But no worries if you're not in the department of CSIE - the goal of this course is really about leveraging English as an effective medium in study, not about learning computer science in English. Nevertheless, throughout the semester we do will learn a bit of computer science as a side effect of no harm :)

**Textbook:**

- (**Required**) "The Elements of Style" by William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White. 4th edition.
- (Optional) "On Writing Well" by William Zinsser.

And we will take some articles from IEEE Xplore and ACM Ditigal Library.
