## Course Syllabus
Fluency in the academic use of English is key to your success in the study of science and engineering. Historically, a significant portion of the body of knowledge is written and communicated in English, and it would be an unfortunate loss to us if the language itself prevents us from the access to it.

In this course, we will introduce the basics of academic English in the setting of science and engineering. The course includes four modules:

1. Effective and critical reading of scientific literature
2. Elements of nonfiction, technical writing style
3. Structures of research papers and technical reports
4. Verbal and visual presentation using academic English

Base on my background, I will cover the materials in the context of computer science and engineering. But no worries if you're not in the department of CSIE - the goal of this course is really about leveraging English as an effective medium in study, not about learning computer science in English. Nevertheless, throughout the semester we do will learn a bit of computer science as a side effect of no harm :)

## Textbook and References
<a name="resource"></a>

### Required Text
"The Elements of Style" by William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White. 4th edition.

### References
The following list will be updated throughout the semester.
Many of the research papers can be found using Google Scholar.
Our school has subscriptions to many digital libraries, so
you should be able to download the listed papers via campus network.

1. "On Writing Well," a book by William Zinsser.
2. Saxena, Abhinav, et al. "Damage propagation modeling for aircraft engine run-to-failure simulation." 2008 international conference on prognostics and health management. IEEE, 2008. (Both the mentioned data set and the paper can be downloaded via NASA's [Prognostics Center of Excellence](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/) data repository, entry 6: Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set.) 

## Accessibility
<a name="integrity"></a>
Students in need are encouraged to bring their considerations to the instructor.

## Academic Integrity
<a name="hw"></a>
Academic integrity is a key component of your education, which is for your benefit. Anyone found to be cheating or helping someone else cheat will receive zero score for that homework/exam. Please reflect on the university's [motto](http://archives.lib.ntnu.edu.tw/c2/c2_1.jsp): Sincerity 誠, Integrity 正, Diligence 勤, Simplicity 樸.

## Homework Assignment 
All homework assignments will be announced on [Moodle](https://moodle.ntnu.edu.tw/).
