## Course Syllabus
This course is designed for first-year undergraduate students, in particular for those who major in computer science and information engineering. The goal is to unveil some "mysterious connections" between physics and computing systems. It is our hope that through this course, students will acquire basic skills to study modern computing systems, such as those for Internet of Things (IoT).

**Grading:**  
* Homework Assignments 45% (every assignment counts) 
* First Exam 20%<a name="schedule"></a> 
* Final Exam 25%  
* Participation 5%  
* Attendance 5%

## Accessibility
<a name="integrity"></a>
Students in need are encouraged to bring their considerations to the instructor.

## Academic Integrity
All homework assignments and exams must be completed individually and independently, except as specifically allowed by the instructor. 

<a name="hw"></a>
Academic integrity is a key component of your education, which is for your benefit. Anyone found to be cheating or helping someone else cheat will receive zero score for that homework/exam. Please reflect on the university's [motto](http://archives.lib.ntnu.edu.tw/c2/c2_1.jsp): Sincerity 誠, Integrity 正, Diligence 勤, Simplicity 樸.

## Homework Assignment 

All homework assignments will be announced on [Moodle](https://moodle.ntnu.edu.tw/).
