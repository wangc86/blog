## Course Syllabus
This course is designed for first-year undergraduate students, in particular for those who major in computer science and information engineering. The goal is to unveil some part of the "mysterious connections" between physics and computing systems. It is our hope that through this course, students will acquire basic skills to explore modern computing systems such as those for Internet of Things (IoT).

**Grading:**  
* Homework 45% (will count the highest six out of seven assignments) 
* First Exam 20%<a name="schedule"></a> ([solution](midterm_solution.pdf)) 
* Final Exam 25%  
* Participation 5%  
* Attendance 5%
