This post is for those who would like to join our lab
and work on [cyber-physical systems (CPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-physical_system) at [National Taiwan Normal University](https://www.ntnu.edu.tw/), in the [department of computer science and information engineering](https://www.csie.ntnu.edu.tw/).

### Undergraduate research opportunity

At NCL, the undergraduate research projects are designed to serve
either of the following two purposes:
  1. To assist students in exploring topics in which they have strong interests.
  2. To have students assist in some projects that we're working on in the lab.

In either case, we call for self-motivated spirits.
Those who would like to participate must enroll in either
CSU0037 or CSU0040 in the same semester.

### Master program

Due to my current capacity (both time and resource),
this summer we can only admit at most three new master students. 

A CS master program is a two-year training in completing
a reasonable sized research project. Master students should
work largely independently, though we will have weekly individual
meeting and group meeting to exchange ideas. In our lab, we
emphasize hands-on experience in systems research, meaning that
students will have ample opportunities to design, analyze, build,
test, and evaluate their prototype CPS systems.

Compared with the undergraduate eduation,
where students spend most of their time learning the knowns,
the graduate education is more about exploring the unknowns
and learning to articulate new findings.
In the graduate study in science and engineering,
this means both the ability to compose and refine research work
(as silver purified seven times) and the ability to present and defend the result
(so that the silver is made into jewelry whose value is clearly seen).
At NCL, we aim to help students develop both abilities.

### PhD program

Working for a PhD degree requires much more significant effort,
but it can be very rewarding. It is typically a 5--7 years of
concentration on a real, open, and important research problem.

On this journey, the student will gradually build up a unique view
to a certain intellectual question in his field of study,
and such a view will be framed into a theory or a system that
he must be able to thoroughly evaluate and articulate in a formal manner.
That is why the full name of PhD is Doctor of Philosophy.

Like planting, the job of a research advisor for graduate students
is to provide resource and guidance along the way,
in the hope that those who decided to take on this journey may
bear much fruits.
