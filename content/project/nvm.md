In 2012-2013, I worked with [Dr. Jon Turner](https://www.arl.wustl.edu/~jst/) on a design and implementation of scalable networked virtual worlds, on top of the [Forest Overlay Network](https://sites.google.com/site/forestoverlaynet/). Our application aims to allow people to join a 3D virtual environment and effectively interact with others. I was working on enabling thousands of avatars to communicate within a local area (e.g., where they can see each other). This includes the design of a scalable networking architecture as well as the study of efficient multicast communcation mechanisms.
