At NCL, we study [Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-physical_system), a reasoned integration of computing and environment, for the joy of re-discoverying how things may work together.

Take a look at our research CV ([English](NCL_intro_english.pdf), [Mandarin](NCL_intro_mandarin.pdf)).
