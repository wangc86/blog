"The heavens declare the glory of God;   
&emsp;    the skies proclaim the work of his hands.   
Day after day they pour forth speech;   
&emsp;    night after night they reveal knowledge.   
They have no speech, they use no words;   
&emsp;    no sound is heard from them.   
Yet their voice goes out into all the earth,   
&emsp;    their words to the ends of the world.   
In the heavens God has pitched a tent for the sun.   
&emsp;    It is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,   
&emsp;    like a champion rejoicing to run his course.   
It rises at one end of the heavens   
&emsp;    and makes its circuit to the other;   
&emsp;    nothing is deprived of its warmth.   

The law of the Lord is perfect,   
&emsp;    refreshing the soul.   
The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy,   
&emsp;    making wise the simple.   
The precepts of the Lord are right,   
&emsp;    giving joy to the heart.   
The commands of the Lord are radiant,   
&emsp;    giving light to the eyes.   
The fear of the Lord is pure,   
&emsp;    enduring forever.   
The decrees of the Lord are firm,   
&emsp;    and all of them are righteous.   

They are more precious than gold,   
&emsp;    than much pure gold;   
they are sweeter than honey,   
&emsp;    than honey from the honeycomb.   
By them your servant is warned;   
&emsp;    in keeping them there is great reward.   
But who can discern their own errors?   
&emsp;    Forgive my hidden faults.   
Keep your servant also from willful sins;   
&emsp;    may they not rule over me.   
Then I will be blameless,   
&emsp;    innocent of great transgression.   

May these words of my mouth and this meditation of my heart   
&emsp;    be pleasing in your sight,   
&emsp;    Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer."   

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_- Psalm 19_
