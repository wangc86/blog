The words of God abides forever and shall not pass away; his faithfulness is unto all generations. (Psalm 119:89--90; Mathew 24:35)

上帝的話安定在天、永不廢去；他的信實長存，直到萬代。（詩篇119:89--90；馬太福音 24:35 ）

> For thus says the high and lofty  
> One that inhabits eternity,  
> whose name is Holy;  
> I dwell in the high and holy place,  
> with him also that is of a contrite  
> and humble spirit, to revive the  
> spirit of the humble, and to revive  
> the heart of the contrite ones.  
> 因為那至高至上、永遠長存  
> 名為聖者的如此說：  
> 我住在至高至聖的所在，  
> 也與心靈痛悔謙卑的人同居；  
> 要使謙卑人的靈甦醒，  
> 也使痛悔人的心甦醒。  

-- Isaiah 以賽亞書 57:15

> Salvation belongs unto the Lord:  
> your blessing is upon your people.  
> 救恩屬乎耶和華；  
> 願你賜福給你的百姓。  

-- Psalm 詩篇 3:8

> that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world: but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us; having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace; and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: and came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh. for through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
>
> Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;
>
> 那時，你們與基督無關，在以色列國民以外，在所應許的諸約上是局外人，並且活在世上沒有指望，沒有上帝。你們從前遠離上帝的人，如今卻在基督耶穌裏，靠著他的血，已經得親近了。因他使我們和睦，將兩下合而為一，拆毀了中間隔斷的牆；而且以自己的身體廢掉冤仇，就是那記在律法上的規條，為要將兩下藉著自己造成一個新人，如此便成就了和睦。既在十字架上滅了冤仇，便藉這十字架使兩下歸為一體，與上帝和好了，並且來傳和平的福音給你們遠處的人，也給那近處的人。因為我們兩下藉著他被一個聖靈所感，得以進到父面前。  
>
> 這樣，你們不再作外人和客旅，是與聖徒同國，是上帝家裏的人了；  


-- Ephesians 以弗所書 2:12--19
