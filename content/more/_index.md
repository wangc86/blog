> I dwell in the high and holy place,

-- Isaiah 57:15

> Salvation belongs unto the Lord:  
> your blessing is upon your people.  

-- Psalm 3:8

> that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world: but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us; having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace; and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: and came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh. for through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
>
> Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;

-- Ephesians 2:12-19
