# Short Bio

Starting in August 2019, I serve as an assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan Normal University. I am interested in timely, dependable, and efficient networked software systems research. In 2014-2019, I worked with [Dr. Chris Gill](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~cdgill/) and [Dr. Chenyang Lu](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~lu/) in Cyber-Physical Systems Laboratory (CPSL). In 2012-2013, I worked with [Dr. Jon Turner](https://www.arl.wustl.edu/~jst/) in Applied Research Laboratory (ARL). In 2009-2010 and 2011-2012, I worked with [Dr. Kuo-Feng Ssu](https://dcl.ee.ncku.edu.tw/wordpress/?p=71) in Dependable Computing Laboratory (DCL).
