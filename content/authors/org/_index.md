* Congratulations to 余承恩, 梅志碩, 鍾尚值, and 林政佑 for their research posters being accepted at [2021 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things Design and Implementation (IoTDI)](https://conferences.computer.org/iotDI/2021/index.html)!  
* <span style="color:green">[Slides]</span> [Our research presentation at the CPS-IoT Week 2020](pdf/iotdi20-arrec-presentation.pdf).  

At NCL, we study [Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-physical_system) --- a reasoned integration of computing and environment --- for the serving of this generation, and for the appreciation of the nature. Take a look at our [research CV](pdf/ncl_cv_2020Aug.pdf).

在 NCL，我們的團隊致力於研究[網宇實體系統](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/網宇實體系統)，在情理內有效地整合資訊工程與物理環境，為社會服務，並一窺自然的奧妙。請參閱[本研究室簡介](pdf/ncl_intro_2020May.pdf)。

"He is like a tree  
planted by streams of water  
that yields its fruit in its season,  
and its leaf does not wither."  
-- Psalm 1:3a
