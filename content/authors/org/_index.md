The Networked Cyber-Physical Systems Laboratory (NCL) was founded in 2019 at National Taiwan Normal University.
At NCL, we study [Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-physical_system), for the service of this generation, and for the joy of exploring where virtual world and physical world meets.

> And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.  
> 他要像一棵樹栽在溪水旁，按時候結果子，葉子也不枯乾。凡他所做的盡都順利。"  

-- Psalm 詩篇 1:3
