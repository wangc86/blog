<span style="color:red">We are recruiting!</span>

At NCL, we study [Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-physical_system) --- a reasoned integration of computing and environment --- for the serving of this generation, and for the appreciation of the nature. Take a look at our [research CV](pdf/ncl_cv_2020Aug.pdf).

在 NCL，我們的團隊致力於研究[網宇實體系統](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/網宇實體系統)，在情理內有效地整合資訊工程與物理環境，為社會服務，並一窺自然的奧妙。請參閱[本研究室簡介](pdf/ncl_intro_2020May.pdf)。

    planted by streams of water<br>
that yields its fruit in its season,<br>
    and its leaf does not wither." <br> _- Psalm 1:3a_
