Chao Wang is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan Normal University. He is interested in building performant networked cyber-physical systems.

On his academic journey, Chao feels grateful to be trained under the direction of both Professor Kuo-Feng Ssu at National Cheng Kung University and Professor Jonathan Turner, Professor Christopher Gill, and Professor Chenyang Lu at Washington University in St. Louis. They guide him and sustain him along this journey.

In his late twenties, Chao received Jesus Christ as his savior. He was commissioned as deacon at Taiwanese Presbyterian Church of Greater St. Louis, and now he serves at National Taiwan Normal University.
